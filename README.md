## What is Open Agent Harness?

Open Agent Harness is a **deployable Agent Engine** that runs agent runtimes and task execution flows. You bring your own frontend, auth, and product experience — the engine handles everything underneath.

**Build your own agent product on top of a reusable engine, instead of rebuilding the engine itself.**

> Not a ready-made chat UI. Not an identity system. Not a SaaS control plane.
> It is the programmable kernel that sits behind all of those.

## Web Console

The project ships with a debug web console for development and inspection:

</p>

The console provides:
- **Conversation view** with streaming, tool call chips, and run tracking
- **Queued follow-ups** so additional user messages wait above the composer while the current run is active, with an explicit `Guide` action to interrupt when desired
- **Inspector** showing model-facing messages, tools, run steps, and engine traces
- **Storage workbench** for PostgreSQL and Redis, including structured `messages.content` inspection

## Architecture

The engine is organized into clear layers:

| Layer | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| **API Gateway** | OpenAPI entry point, parameter validation, access control, SSE streaming |
| **Session Orchestrator** | Run creation, per-session serial scheduling, cancellation, timeout, failure recovery |
| **Context Engine** | Assembles prompts, history, agent config, and capability catalog at run start |
| **LLM Loop + Dispatcher** | Model inference, tool calling, routing, and result backfill |
| **Execution Backend** | Local directory-level execution (swappable to container/VM/remote sandbox) |
| **Storage** | PostgreSQL (source of truth) + Redis (queues, locks, SSE) + local workspace engine state |

## Workspace-First Design

The **workspace** is the core customization boundary. A single engine can host many workspaces, each with its own:

- Agents and prompt strategies
- Skills, actions, and tools
- Hooks and lifecycle policies
- Model configurations
- Tool servers (local or remote)

Two workspaces on the same engine can behave completely differently for different teams, repos, or product scenarios.

Current public workspace shape:

| Workspace Kind | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **`project`** | The standard workspace kind. Writable execution, local file access, actions, skills, tools, and hooks all hang off the same workspace model. |

## Capability Model

Each capability layer stays separate so you can compose them differently per workspace:

| Capability | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `agent` | Defines role, behavior, and permissions of a working persona |
| `primary agent` / `subagent` | User-facing specialists and delegated background specialists |
| `tool` | Built-in or external execution capabilities for agents |
| `skill` | Reusable know-how packaged for a class of tasks |
| `action` | Stable named tasks that users, APIs, or agents can trigger |
| `hook` | Lifecycle interception, policy, and extension logic around engine events |
| `context` | Controls how prompts and workspace instructions are assembled for the model |

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Point to your external deploy root directory
export OAH_DEPLOY_ROOT=/absolute/path/to/test_oah_server

# Start the local stack (PostgreSQL + Redis + MinIO + oah-api + oah-controller + oah-sandbox)
# This also waits for MinIO and auto-runs one storage sync.
pnpm local:up

# Start the web console (in another terminal)
pnpm dev:web
```

### Start And Stop Flow

```bash
cd /Users/wumengsong/Code/OpenAgentHarness
export OAH_DEPLOY_ROOT=/absolute/path/to/test_oah_server

pnpm local:up
```

Stop everything:

```bash
cd /Users/wumengsong/Code/OpenAgentHarness
pnpm local:down
```

This local stack is designed for a single OAH instance on host port `8787`. If you want multiple OAH replicas later, keep the same service split and put OAH behind a reverse proxy or a K8s Service instead of binding each replica directly to the host.

**Local addresses:**

| Service | URL |
| --- | --- |
| Web Console | `http://localhost:5174` |
| `oah-api` | `http://127.0.0.1:8787` |
| `oah-sandbox` internal worker | `http://127.0.0.1:8788` |
| `oah-controller` metrics | `http://127.0.0.1:8789` |
| MinIO Console | `http://127.0.0.1:9001` |

### Single Workspace Mode

Run a dedicated backend for one workspace:

```bash
pnpm exec tsx --tsconfig ./apps/server/tsconfig.json ./apps/server/src/index.ts -- \
  --workspace /absolute/path/to/workspace \
  --model-dir /absolute/path/to/models \
  --default-model openai-default
```

### Common Commands

```bash
pnpm build          # Build all packages
pnpm test           # Run tests
OAH_DEPLOY_ROOT=/absolute/path/to/test_oah_server pnpm storage:sync  # Push readonly source prefixes to MinIO
OAH_DEPLOY_ROOT=/absolute/path/to/test_oah_server pnpm storage:sync -- --include-workspaces  # Also sync source/workspaces
OAH_DEPLOY_ROOT=/absolute/path/to/test_oah_server pnpm local:up      # Start oah-api + oah-controller + oah-sandbox and auto-sync once
pnpm local:down                                                    # Stop local Docker stack
pnpm exec tsx --tsconfig ./apps/server/tsconfig.json ./apps/server/src/worker.ts -- --config ./server.example.yaml  # Advanced: start a standalone worker (typically sandbox-hosted)
```

If `server.docker.yaml` omits `workers.embedded`, `pnpm local:up` now seeds the sandbox-local worker pool with `min_count: 2` and `max_count: 4`, so background tools and subagents can overlap by default instead of collapsing to a single execution slot.
If `workers.standalone.min_replicas` and `sandbox.fleet.min_count` are both omitted, the local stack now keeps `1` warm `oah-sandbox` replica by default so session prewarm still has a live target and first-message latency stays low. Set either value to `0` explicitly if you want local scale-to-zero behavior instead.

## Who Is It For?

**Good fit:**
- Teams building internal AI platforms or agent products — developers define agent logic, users switch agents by scenario
- Projects that need one backend serving many workspaces in parallel
- Products that want to keep their own frontend, auth, and UX while reusing a shared runtime
- Scenarios requiring more control than a fixed agent UI or thin local agent loop

**Not the best fit:**
- You just want a ready-made chat UI
- You only need a tiny single-user local script
- You don't need workspace isolation or engine lifecycle management

## Use Cases

| Scenario | Why it works |
| --- | --- |
| Internal engineering copilot | Different repos/teams share one runtime with different agent setups |
| Multi-agent product | Developers define agent logic, users switch agents by scenario — all on one runtime |
| Embedded copilot in an existing product | Runtime stays headless, fits behind your app |
| Single-repo dedicated backend | `single workspace` mode gives a focused deployment path |
