# Runtime Overview

The runtime is responsible for turning an incoming request into a traceable, recoverable, auditable run.

## What the Runtime Has to Solve

- transform caller input into executable runs
- enforce per-session serialization
- discover workspace capabilities and build context
- map model tool calls to Actions, Skills, MCP, and native tools
- handle timeout, cancellation, logging, audit, and streaming
- sync central history into `.openharness/data/history.db`
